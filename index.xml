      <description>This game has an abundance of deal-breakers:
 Queue times are so large that the game sometimes does not even let you get in queue. When it lets you, expect 6 hours or more. Booting up takes minutes. Opening most UI elements in-game freezes the game for a few seconds. Time-gated end-game: limited chaos dungeons, scheduled raids, timed stronghold upgrades and more. Uninspired, unchallenging and boring progression until the beginning of the end-game (level 50-ish).</description>

      <description>Introduction In this article, I will explain the steps for creating a blog like mine: static, automatically generated and hosted for free.
Framework I have built this blog using Hugo and the hello-friend-ng theme, and host it on GitHub Pages.
Workflow I use a private Git repository to version the development side of the blog (such that drafts will not be public), and use a public repository named xphyro.github.io to host the public web site.</description>
