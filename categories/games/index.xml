      <description>This game has an abundance of deal-breakers:&#xA;Queue times are so large that the game sometimes does not even let you get in queue. When it lets you, expect 6 hours or more. Booting up takes minutes. Opening most UI elements in-game freezes the game for a few seconds. Time-gated end-game: limited chaos dungeons, scheduled raids, timed stronghold upgrades and more. Uninspired, unchallenging and boring progression until the beginning of the end-game (level 50-ish).</description>
